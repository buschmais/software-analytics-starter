# software-analytics-starter

This is a starter project for Software Analytics with jQAssistant, Neo4j, Jupyter Notebooks, and mybinder.

## Example Project

This starter uses the shopizer e-Commerce Shop System (Version 2.12.0) for analysis. It was only modified in the way that jQAssistant was added. The link to the fork can be found in the "resources" section.

## How to Use

To launch the Jupyter Notebook simply click the mybinder badge on top of this readme. 
A new tab will then be opened where you can see the environment including Jupyter and Neo4j getting spinned up.

Once ready, you can open the Jupyter Notebooks, execute the given queries, write new ones and get into Software Analytics.
